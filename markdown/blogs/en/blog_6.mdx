# Inclusion as a Strategy

Women form the backbone of the Tanzanian informal economy, yet they often face the most significant barriers to traditional capital. At Nelion Finance, we are committed to dismantling these barriers through inclusive lending models that value potential and character.

- Flexible credit terms designed for diverse business models.
- Mentorship programs focused on financial literacy and scaling.
- Community-based lending structures that foster mutual support.
