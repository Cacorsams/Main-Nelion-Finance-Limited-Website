The SimplePay Foundation
SimplePay foundation was established to direct our resources and social work to causes we truly believe in;

Womens Empowerment – We seek out opportunities to enhance Women’s abilities, opportunities, and capacities to control their own lives and contributing to bettering those of their families. It involves providing women with the tools and resources necessary to make informed decisions, exercise their rights and participate actively in social and economic spheres. We have indulged in projects individually as well as collaborated with reputable professionals, schools, and charity organizations whose values align with ours. We have found that there is such an urgency to address some of the basic scarcities and human rights violations that some of these women are facing.

Unrivalled Customer Impact 
Quote
“4G Capital is the best place for visionary business people to grow and thrive as unlike other lenders, they trust you first, then build the relationship later"
Meet Floridah Murugi from vibrant Meru County, Kenya. She embarked on a life-changing journey to the town of Lodwar during her college years and, captivated by its promise, decided to make it her permanent home. Eleven years ago, with courage and vision, she opened a small beauty shop in the heart of town. The beginning was challenging, with daily earnings of around $20. However, Floridah was determined not to return to her village and recognized the incredible potential of this rapidly flourishing town, she was resolutely determined to succeed.

 

Her vision has always been to create a one-stop shop where her customers can enjoy both quality and affordability. Then, in April 2022, a visit from the 4G Capital team brought a new dawn to her dreams.
